        <h4>Here is a time line of Dr Borlaug's life:</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of <br> Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth <br> Administration"</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the <br> Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me." </li>
            <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
            <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due <br> to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study <br> under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor <br> attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on <br> waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
            <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind <br> his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
            <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
            <li><strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a <br> high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It <br> goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
            <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat <br> to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a <br> rapidly expanding population</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li><strong>1983</strong> - Helps seven African countries dramatically increase their <br> maize and sorghum yields</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by <br> 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the <br> demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently <br> dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - Dies at the age of 95.</li>
